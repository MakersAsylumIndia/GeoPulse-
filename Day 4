App Development, Data Integration, and Final Assembly
On the final day, we concentrated on integrating all the elements that we had built. We decided to build the application that would receive the data from the sensors and display it in an appropriate way. The data from the different sensors was integrated to give a better understanding of the soil condition, instead of basing the understanding on one sensor. We also concentrated on the interpretation of the data to ensure that the application could provide valuable information, such as the requirement for watering of the soil or the suitability of the environmental conditions for growing a crop.
We then proceed to integrate the hardware and software together with the application to create a full system. The integration involved the testing of data transfer and the correction of errors. However, at the end of the day, a project that was an idea in the morning was completed in the sense that it was able to function as a soil analyzer.
