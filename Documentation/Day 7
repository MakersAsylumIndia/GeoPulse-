Day 7 - rehersals and changes
Day 7 was utilized to practice the pitch presentation. Each section was timed so that the presentation did not exceed its required limit. With each practice, we enhanced the transitions, visuals, and explanation of technical concepts so as not to confuse the audience.
We have also prepared some responses to anticipated questions by the judges or mentors, which ranged from scalability to precision accuracy, sensor life span, and how we would handle large-scale deployment to farming communities.
This day gave us the confidence in our message and clarity of communication as a team.
