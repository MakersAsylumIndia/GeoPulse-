We started to define the problem in a real-world scenario. Most farmers are unable to access reasonable tools that could help them understand soil health, which causes crop failure and wasted money, along with uncertainty regarding the outcomes of harvests. This was our problem statement and Hence, became the pivot of our design direction.
During this session, we brainstormed what the device needed in order to be useful: to give out readings of moisture level, tracking of humidity and temperature, analysis of soil quality, and finally integrating AI to give suggestions to farmers based on sensor data. We also thought about cost limitations and decided our device must stay affordable even at low production scale.
We concluded the day with a straightforward 8-day roadmap in writing. The plan involved testing of sensors, CAD design, hardware assembly, enclosure production, app development, and a pitch for the final product. We came to a goal: create something functional, durable, low-cost, easy to use for farmers.
 of each team member, which helped to show collaboration, skill distribution, and the maturity of the project. Public presentation of the product gave an invaluable experience in professional communication and rapid problem-solving.
