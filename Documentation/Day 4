Day 4 - Assembly of Prototype and First Draft of CAD
Day 4: On the fourth day, the electrical system was started to be assembled on a breadboard. The intention of this was to make a functional circuit that could read all the sensor values simultaneously. In this way, the behavior of the sensors together instead of individually could be tested. Combining them revealed some issues with spacing and cable management, but we adjusted our layout to keep data stable.
Simultaneously, work started on the CAD model of our enclosure. The first version of the case was mainly focused on fitting every component comfortably. However, the walls were unnecessarily thick and the filament usage was extremely high; a full print would be expensive and time consuming.
At the end of the day, we considered what needed to be modified in the enclosure. Among all, material cost and printing duration were the main concerns. Since affordability for farmers is our mission, we realized the need for a redesign.
