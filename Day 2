Day 2 — Assignment of Tasks & Setup
On Day 2, we organized our team based on individual strengths. We assigned Hridaan to handle the electronics and wiring since he has much familiarity with circuitry. Shaurya was assigned the responsibility of developing an app by using MIT App Inventor since he is interested in software and interface design. Hansuja took on CAD design, documentation, GitHub maintenance, project communication, and pitch development.
Then, we went ahead and set up our workflow. We had to install Arduino IDE, MIT App Inventor, Fusion 360, and configure a shared GitHub repository to keep track of all the versions. By setting these tools early on in the process, we were able to avoid many situations that would cause confusion later in the process.
Finally, we created a shared work schedule. This allowed us to plan around task dependencies. For instance, the enclosure could not be printed until the sensor sizing was confirmed, and the app could not be designed without knowing how sensor data would be formatted. This organization made our workflow clearer and more professional.
